Add an opt-in durable element `ref` to the `query` verb so an agent can read a list, pick a row, and act on THAT element later even after the page mutates between read and act (fixing the index-drift footgun where a positional `.nth(i)` silently clicks the wrong row). Second deliverable of the "broaden the agent verb surface" prd.

`query(locator, {refs: true})` adds a `ref` to each returned row, computed by a PREFERENCE LADDER: it REUSES the element's own stable, VERIFIED-UNIQUE attribute when present (priority `id`, then `data-testid`/`data-test`/`data-id`, `name`, a link's `href`, a unique `aria-label`) so the ref IS the element's real locator (durable across framework reconciliation, zero DOM mutation); it MINTS a namespaced `data-webhands-ref` attribute ONLY as the fallback for an anonymous element. A spike against REAL React 18 keyed-list and Svelte 4 `{#each}` re-renders settled the mint mechanism as an ATTRIBUTE (not a page-world `WeakMap`): against real reconciliation the two survive/die on the same cases, and the attribute alone is a locator string the one existing resolver resolves with no parallel addressing path.

`click`/`type` accept the ref with `{byRef: true}` (CLI `--by-ref`): the ref is resolved through the SAME single resolver but asserted to match EXACTLY ONE element first. A ref that now resolves to ZERO (the element was removed/replaced by a re-render or a navigation) or to MORE THAN ONE (a cloned subtree carrying the minted attribute) fails LOUD with a typed `StaleRefError` — never a silent wrong-element action, which is strictly safer than `.nth()`.

Refs are OPT-IN: the default `query` (no `refs`) performs NO DOM write and returns no `ref` (a pure read), and minted attributes are namespaced and single-`query`-scoped (a fresh `refs: true` query sweeps the prior query's mints first). The `ref` is an additive optional row field and resolves through the one existing resolver, preserving the prd's reversibility shape. `StaleRefError` is exported from `@webhands/core` and the CLI maps it to a re-query fix hint.
